üëã Hi, I'm @MINMOSTWHATTHEMEANING (Bass)

üëÄ I'm passionate about creating immersive and terrifying 3D first-person horror games, specifically for mobile platforms. I'm inspired by the unsettling atmosphere of games like *Shadow Corridor* and driven by a desire to push the boundaries of mobile horror.

üå± I'm constantly expanding my skills in Godot Engine 4, Python, and AI-assisted game development. I'm exploring new techniques for optimizing performance on mobile devices and experimenting with procedural generation and AI-driven storytelling.

üíûÔ∏è I'm open to collaborations on exciting horror game projects.  If you're an artist, sound designer, or fellow developer with a passion for the macabre, let's connect!
