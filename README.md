ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm @MINMOSTWHATTHEMEANING (Bass).  I'm an indie game developer ðŸ’€ and AI enthusiast ðŸ¤– crafting terrifying 3D first-person horror experiences, entirely on mobile.

ðŸ”¥ Crafting Immersive Horror: I'm fueled by a passion to redefine mobile horror. I'm inspired by the unsettling atmosphere of games like *Shadow Corridor* and constantly exploring innovative ways to deliver truly terrifying experiences on mobile devices. I'm experimenting with procedural generation, AI-driven narratives, and advanced 3D graphics to push the boundaries of mobile horror.


ðŸš€ Mastering Mobile Dev & AI:  I'm a self-taught developer with a relentless focus on mastering mobile game development and the power of AI.  I'm pushing the limits of what's possible on mobile devices with Godot Engine 4, Python, and a suite of AI tools.  I'm constantly learning and experimenting, pushing myself beyond conventional mobile game development boundaries.
